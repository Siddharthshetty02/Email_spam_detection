A machine learning-based email spam detection system that classifies emails as **spam** or **ham (not spam)**. The project includes a **Flask backend** for serving the AI model and a **responsive frontend** for user interaction.

---

## **Features**
- **Spam Detection**: Classifies emails as spam or ham using a trained machine learning model.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple web interface for users to input email text and get predictions.
- **Scalable Backend**: Built with Flask, making it easy to deploy and scale.
- **Efficient Preprocessing**: Uses NLTK for text cleaning, tokenization, and stemming.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Joblib
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Machine Learning**: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, TF-IDF Vectorization
- **Deployment**: Local or cloud-based (e.g., Heroku, Streamlit)

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-spam-detection.git
cd email-spam-detection
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Navigate to the `backend/` folder and install the required Python packages:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Train the Model**
Run the `train_model.py` script to train the spam detection model:
```bash
python train_model.py
```
This will generate a trained model file (`spam_detection_model.pkl`) in the `backend/` folder.

### **4. Start the Flask Backend**
Run the Flask app to start the backend server:
```bash
python app.py
```
The backend will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### **5. Serve the Frontend**
Open the `frontend/index.html` file in your browser or use a tool like **Live Server** in VS Code to serve the frontend.

---

## **Usage**
1. Open the frontend in your browser.
2. Enter the email text in the text area.
3. Click **Check for Spam**.
4. The result (Spam or Ham) will be displayed below the form.

---

## **Dataset**
The model is trained on the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection). You can replace this dataset with your own CSV file containing email data.

---

## **Customization**
- **Dataset**: Replace `datasets/email.csv` with your own dataset. Ensure it has columns for `label` (spam/ham) and `text` (email content).
- **Model**: Modify `train_model.py` to use a different machine learning algorithm (e.g., SVM, Random Forest).
- **Frontend**: Customize the `frontend/` files to change the look and feel of the web interface.

---

## **Deployment**
### **Local Deployment**
- Run the Flask backend and serve the frontend as described above.

### **Cloud Deployment**
- Deploy the Flask app on **Heroku** or **AWS**.
- Use **Streamlit** for a quick deployment of the frontend and backend.
